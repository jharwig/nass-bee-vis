## Original Project Description
Two organizations, the Honeybee Conservancy and the UDSA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) are both doing great work to protect bees. They have lots of data, but lack engaging ways to present it for donors, grant applications, scientists, media, and the public. They would like help in better visualizing this data.

### Goals:

1. (This repository is for the second goal) Visualizations for [data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LgwlhlL9xfainEq4ax0TWCci81oaAMrIGjdB0v51Hnk/edit#gid=508249099) ([also](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hNtTj5TpQ4wFCKAwKDqVjfT7em9f7I7I_Y7gzPpt-HE/edit?pli=1#gid=1992699869)) on the Honeybee Conservance Sponsor-a-Hive program

2. Heap map visualization and interactive data visualization for the [Honey Bee Colonies Report](https://usda.library.cornell.edu/concern/publications/rn301137d?locale=en) and the [Honey Report](https://usda.library.cornell.edu/concern/publications/hd76s004z?locale=en)

## Setup

### Extracting the data

### Development

Install dependencies:

```console
$ npm install
```

Start the development server:

```console
$ npm start
```

Run linter and tsc 

```console
$ npm test
```

## TODOs

* Map & graph need to be clearer about units being used. (The values for some data categories are actually x 1000 -- this isn't mentioned anywhere as of yet.)
